### 🔑 **Modular Monolith Architecture for Your Django App**

---

### 🏗️ **1. Project Directory Structure**

The goal is to **separate concerns** into modules (apps) but still keep everything in one Django project during your initial build phase. Here's how you might structure it:

```
finance_analyst_be/

├── core/                    # Core shared models, utilities, constants
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── settings.py          # Settings for Django project

│   ├── serializers.py       # Alert settings and rules

### 🧩 **App Breakdown**

Each app will focus on a **single responsibility** (SRP) and will help you **separate features** effectively. Below is a brief breakdown of the core apps:

---

### **1. `core/` App (Global Setup)**
- **Purpose:** Houses the general configuration of your Django project (e.g., settings, URL routing).
- **Contains:**
  - `settings.py`: Configuration settings like database, middleware, installed apps.
  - `urls.py`: Global URL routing across the project.

---

### **2. `accounts/` App (Chart of Accounts & Actual Data)**
- **Purpose:** Manages everything related to accounts, actual financial data, and companies.
- **Contains:**
  - `models.py`: Contains models like `Company`, `Account`, `Actual`, etc.
  - `serializers.py`: Serializes models for API consumption.
  - `views.py`: CRUD views to manage accounts and companies.
  - `tasks.py`: (If needed) tasks related to account data processing.
  - `urls.py`: Endpoints for accounts management (e.g., `/api/accounts/`, `/api/actuals/`).

---

### **3. `forecasting/` App (Financial Forecasting Engine)**
- **Purpose:** Manages all forecast models, calculations, and assumptions.
- **Contains:**
  - `models.py`: Models for storing forecasts, line items, and assumptions.
  - `serializers.py`: Serialize forecast data to API.
  - `views.py`: Views for interacting with forecast data.
  - `tasks.py`: Celery tasks for calculating forecasts (e.g., if the forecast engine is heavy, offload calculations).
  - `urls.py`: API endpoints for creating, retrieving, and updating forecasts.

---

### **4. `insights/` App (AI Insights)**
- **Purpose:** Handles AI or ML-based insights generation (e.g., using GPT, OpenAI API).
- **Contains:**
  - `models.py`: If storing insights or predictions, model them here.
  - `serializers.py`: Serialize insights data for API consumption.
  - `views.py`: View that triggers AI-based insights (e.g., generate insights based on financial data).
  - `tasks.py`: Celery tasks for asynchronous processing (e.g., generate insights in the background).
  - `urls.py`: API for generating insights and retrieving them.

---

### **5. `reporting/` App (Reports & Dashboards)**
- **Purpose:** Handles the generation of reports and financial dashboards.
- **Contains:**
  - `models.py`: If storing any report-related data (like periods or KPIs).
  - `serializers.py`: Serialize reports and financial data.
  - `views.py`: Views for generating reports (e.g., monthly P&L, cash flow).
  - `tasks.py`: If generating large reports or doing complex calculations, use Celery for background work.
  - `urls.py`: API endpoints for retrieving reports.

---

### **6. `alerts/` App (Alerting & Notification System)**
- **Purpose:** Manages alert thresholds (e.g., variance alerts, KPI breaches) and notification rules.
- **Contains:**
  - `models.py`: Models for thresholds (e.g., "notify me when net income < $50,000").
  - `serializers.py`: Serialize alert rules and preferences.
  - `views.py`: Manage alert settings and triggering.
  - `tasks.py`: Use Celery to periodically check for breaches in thresholds and send notifications (e.g., email, Slack).
  - `urls.py`: API for managing alert rules and retrieving triggered alerts.

---

## 🚀 **Deployment Strategy & Next Steps**

### 🏗️ **MVP Development (Phase 1)**:
- Focus on building the **core functionality** and key modules (Accounts, Forecasting, Insights).
- Keep everything as a **single Django project**.
- **Use Celery** for background processing (e.g., heavy calculations, AI tasks).

### 🚀 **Scalability (Phase 2)**:
- After MVP success, look into separating **forecasting**, **insights**, and **alerting** into microservices if needed.
- Add **API Gateway** (e.g., Kong, API Gateway) for service orchestration.
- Use **Docker** for containerization and **Kubernetes** for scaling.

---

### ✨ **Benefits of This Modular Monolith Approach:**
1. **Faster Development:** Build features quickly in a single repo, no worrying about service communication yet.
2. **Separation of Concerns:** Isolate different parts of your business logic, but all within the same Django app structure.
3. **Scalability:** You can move to microservices when scaling is needed but won’t be constrained at the start.

This should give you a solid foundation to start working on the backend while leaving room for growth and scale!
