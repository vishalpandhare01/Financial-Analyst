## 🚦 Step-by-Step Development Plan

### **STEP 1: Setup Environment**
- PostgreSQL DB
- Backend with FastAPI, Django, or Node.js
- Basic frontend with React or simple HTML templates

---

### **STEP 2: Authentication & User Roles**
- Register/Login users
- Assign roles (admin, analyst, company user)

---

### **STEP 3: Company & Financial Data Input**
- Allow user to create a company
- Upload or manually enter financial statements
- Parse CSV or Excel into `financial_statements` and `financial_entries`

---

### **STEP 4: Calculation Engine**
- Backend job to:
  - Calculate ratios (e.g., current ratio = current assets / current liabilities)
  - Store in `ratios`

---

### **STEP 5: Forecasting Engine (Basic)**
- Use Prophet or simple regression to forecast:
  - Revenue, expenses, profit
- Store in `forecasts`

---

### **STEP 6: Recommendation System (MVP)**
- Rule-based logic first:
  - "If net income < 0 for 2 quarters, recommend cost-cutting"
- Later, integrate ML/NLP models
- Store in `recommendations`

---

### **STEP 7: Dashboards & Reports**
- Query and visualize:
  - Income trend
  - Key ratios
  - Forecast charts
  - Recommendations
