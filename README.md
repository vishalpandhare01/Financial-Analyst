## ‚úÖ Project Workflow: Financial Analyst Automation with Formulas & Logic

---

### 1. **Company Setup & Account Structure**
#### Goal:
Let users (CFOs, founders) create a company and define a **Chart of Accounts**.

#### Workflow:
- User creates a company profile.
- System generates or imports the Chart of Accounts (COA).
- Accounts are tagged by type: `Revenue`, `COGS`, `Expense`, `Asset`, `Liability`, etc.

---

### 2. **Import or Input Actual Financial Data**
#### Goal:
Bring in real accounting data (from Excel, QuickBooks, Xero, etc.).

#### Workflow:
- Upload or API-sync actual monthly data.
- Store data in `actuals` table, linked to accounts and company.

#### Example:
| Month | Revenue | COGS | OpEx |
|-------|---------|------|------|
| Jan   | 100,000 | 40,000 | 20,000 |

---

### 3. **Driver Setup (for Forecasting)**
#### Goal:
Define business drivers that affect forecasts.

#### Workflow:
- User inputs key drivers: unit sales, pricing, conversion rate, headcount, CAC, etc.
- Drivers are linked to forecast line items (e.g., revenue = units √ó price).

#### Example Formula:
```
Revenue = Units Sold √ó Average Selling Price
```
```
COGS = Units Sold √ó Cost per Unit
```
```
Gross Profit = Revenue - COGS
```

---

### 4. **Build Financial Model (Forecast Engine)**
#### Goal:
Generate a forward-looking forecast based on past data and drivers.

#### Workflow:
- User creates a forecast model: 12-month, 3-year, etc.
- Model copies structure from Chart of Accounts.
- System fills values based on:
  - Historical average (for simple mode)
  - Growth rates (e.g., 10% MoM)
  - Drivers (for dynamic revenue and expense)

#### Example Forecasting Formulas:
```
Future Revenue = Last Month Revenue √ó (1 + Growth Rate)
Operating Expense = Headcount √ó Cost per Employee
Net Income = Revenue - COGS - OpEx - Taxes
Cash Flow = Net Income + Depreciation - CapEx
```

---

### 5. **Versioning & Scenario Modeling**
#### Goal:
Let users create multiple versions (base case, best case, worst case).

#### Workflow:
- Each model is saved with a version and scenario type.
- Forecasts adjust based on new assumptions or driver values.

---

### 6. **Variance Analysis**
#### Goal:
Compare actual performance vs. forecast to understand gaps.

#### Workflow:
- System pulls actuals and forecasts by period and account.
- Calculates difference and % variance.

#### Example Formula:
```
Variance = Actual - Forecast
Variance % = (Variance / Forecast) √ó 100
```

#### Use Case:
If Actual Revenue = $95,000 and Forecast = $100,000:
```
Variance = -5,000
Variance % = -5%
```

---

### 7. **AI Insight Generation**
#### Goal:
Generate narrative summaries explaining financial performance.

#### Workflow:
- System analyzes variances and trends.
- Sends prompts to GPT/OpenAI to create natural language explanations.

#### Example Output:
> ‚ÄúRevenue fell short of forecast by 5% in March, primarily due to lower-than-expected conversion rates despite stable traffic volume.‚Äù

---

### 8. **Reporting & Dashboards**
#### Goal:
Display all KPIs, forecasts, and trends via APIs to frontend.

#### Workflow:
- API returns time series for Revenue, Gross Margin, Net Income, etc.
- Graphs are powered by JSON endpoints.
- Downloadable reports: P&L, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow, KPI Summary.

---

### 9. **Alerting & Notifications (Optional)**
#### Goal:
Notify users when key metrics fall outside thresholds.

#### Workflow:
- Define rules (e.g., ‚Äúalert me if Net Income drops more than 20%‚Äù).
- System checks actuals vs. rule logic and triggers email/Slack alert.

---

## üöß What Might Still Need Manual Setup (Initially)

These aren‚Äôt daily analyst tasks but still require *some user input or config:*

- Connecting to the accounting system (API keys, credentials)
- Initial setup of Chart of Accounts (or import)
- Inputting business drivers (e.g., growth %, unit cost, hiring plan)
- Creating model versions (the system can duplicate and update, but you initiate it)

---

## üß† Summary: Is It Fully Automated?

‚úÖ **Yes, for 90‚Äì95% of analyst work**  
üí° **Human input only needed for business assumptions and approvals**

You‚Äôre basically building a **self-updating, explainable, and intelligent financial engine**.
